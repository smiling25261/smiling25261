⚡ Fun fact: "A problem is not solved until it is solved for everyone."
This quote emphasizes the idea that a solution is only truly complete when it works for all people or all scenarios, reflecting a commitment to accessibility, scalability, and inclusivity in problem-solving. It’s often used in the context of software engineering or product development to highlight the importance of creating solutions that are robust and cater to diverse needs.
